                My name is Kyle Fink, welcome to my website! I'm a student at Grand Valley State University on my 5th year studying Computer Science.
                I grew up in a small town called Bear Lake where we had very little opportunities growing up to experience things many others would have. 
                In high school, I was part of the National Honor Society, the National Technical Honor Society, and Achieved my Eagle Scout through the 
                Boy Scouts of America, troop 106, in 2019. I also participated in numerous years of sports for our highschool including Cross Country, Golf, 
                Basketball, Football, and I was on the high school First Robotics team. I was very active in the community, doing volunteer things with the 
                Boy Scouts like helping hand out waters and medals to runners after the annual Bay Shore Marathon in Traverse City. I also helped with 
                selling tickets at ball games, helping run concession stands for ball games, and setting up/cleaning up after events at the school.

            <h1>Job Experience</h1>
                <h3>GE Aerospace - Muskegon</h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked at GE Aerospace at the Muskegon plants during the 2024 summer as part of an internship opportunity. At GE I expanded my skills using SQL by 
                        gaining real world experience using real data. I encountered SQL queries that I had never even heard of and had to adapt and learn how the new queries 
                        worked. I learned how to use Oracle APEX for web development, I got experience talking to a customer and getting feedback from the customer to make 
                        changes for the program I was developing. I also got some experience doing simple IT tasks like fixing computers, fixing desk phones, setting up printers,
                        working with IDFs, and solving IT problems over the phone from a central IT Help Desk phone.

            <h1>Coding Experience</h1>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    C# was my first exposure to the world of coding. I took an intro to C# class at a small college called Northwestern Michigan College in Traverse City, 
                    Michigan. There my professor John Velis really sold coding and made it fun, fun enough that I would later make Computer science my major. Pursuing 
                    this degree has encouraged me to learn many other different languages to broaden my skills in the computer science field, some languages ive learned are
                    obscure and not well known and others are extremely well known and documented. In this section im going to go more in depth into some of the more well known 
                    languages ive gotten to know and how ive used them in classes.
                </p>
            <h3>C#</h3>
                <p>
                    My first ever class was in the language of C#. While learning C# I made larger and larger projects as required from the class with some free range 
                    to pick what projects we wanted to work on. I opted to make a small ATM for my first project. This ATM had a way to make an account and password 
                    and would require you to login in order to withdraw or deposit any hypothetical money. </p><br>
                <p>
                    Later on when I took the more experienced C# class or projects got larger and more complex. During that semester we got the opportunity to code 
                    with "Finch" robots. These robots had many different sensors on them to monitor the world around them. Along with those they also had the ability 
                    to make noise and move around form two small wheels. Our final project for the second C# class was to make a text based quest game. My game was based 
                    around the Star Wars franchise where it prompted the player to enter their name, age, what race from star wars they would like to be called, and 
                    what side of the force they would like to choose. The initial game would load where the player could move from planet to planet, interact with NPCs
                    fight bad NPCs, and collect parts for a lightsaber along with some other items to aid them along their journey.
                </p><br>
            <h3>Java</h3>
                <p>
                    When I transferred colleges to Grand Valley State University the first classes I had to take were intro classes for the Java language. Because C# is 
                    very similar to Java, this transition was pretty simple. In the more experienced Java class we were tasked to make a Tic Tac Toe game that would 
                    prompt the player to enter what size of a board they wanted from 3x3 up to 15x15, and how many in a row they wanted to be a win. Once we got that 
                    working we were tasked to create an opponent that would attempt to block you from getting a win. Overall a very fun project and the end product was 
                    semi hard to beat the CPU which made it all worth while.
                </p><br>
            <h3>SQL</h3>
                <p>
                    SQL was something ive always thought was fun and had potential to be linked to most things. When I first took a SQL class at NMC we had a project to 
                    create a database with multiple tables and made up data to query for projects. I thought it was fairly simple but also super cool. Later when I 
                    transferred to GVSU I had to retake a database class at GV so I got to experience it again and in some parts in more detail. In this class we focused 
                    more on writing the actual query to retrieve the data from databases. The summer of 2024 I had the ability to work at GE Aerospace in Muskegon where
                    we us SQL as the main form of coding practice. I got a ton of real world experience with SQL and it allowed me to grow my knowledge of the language greatly.
                </p>
            <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    Ive taken one web development class that focused on HTML5 and CSS. Instantly my creativity took off with possibilities of what could be done. 
                    Originally started with a very basic website but then later it evolved to playing around with whats possible an finally into me making this website. 
                    The website was made off a template from a video that I later customized to personalize it and make it my own for a Computer graphics class to publish 
                    my work and projects I had completed in that class. That was when I had the idea to later change it into the portfolio website you are reading now.
                </p>
            <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>
                    Python is a language that im not as familiar with as other languages. A year after I had learned Java at GVSU they had changed everything to Python 
                    forcing us to learn python for classes. Ive never been officially taught Python but I taught it to myself to keep up with my classes. Some things Ive 
                    done with python include programming search algorithms, creating a local server to communicate with a web-server
